      <h2>The Story</h2>
      <p>
      A few days ago, GitHub announced that from now on they will start to only host closed-source software and be payment-only. Millions of open source developers cried out in horror as they read
      about it on reddit and slashdot. At the same time and probably completely unrealted, millions of parents were wondering about the sounds coming from their basement.
      </p>
      <p>
      After the first moment of shock was gone, geeks all over the world started to hit GitHub hard trying to get the latest revision of every project they care about. But it was to late. They
      couldn't even access their own repositories without paying a fortune (relative to what the average OSS developing student earns). After massive protests and tons of sad kitties were
      meme-fied nothing changed at GitHub. No one from the GitHub HQ seemed to care about the billions of messages all over Facebook and Twitter (some even on G+).
      </p>
      <p>
      But a few developers knew what was going on. Every member was wearing the mandatory tinfoil (many where still waiting for a tinfoil hat in TF2) hat and they knew what was going on:
      Aliens must have made the GitHub staff their slaves by using mind-controlling brainwave-manipulating reality-augmenting Elerium-powered zombiefication devices.

      And so they formed an organization to restore GitHub to it's former glory.  They are the <strong>S</strong>ociety of <strong>A</strong>ngry <strong>D</strong>evelopers
      <strong>N</strong>egating <strong>E</strong>xtraterrestrial <strong>R</strong>evision <strong>D</strong>estruction (SADNERD).
      </p>
      <p>
      Over the last days, the members of SADNERD have been raiding instances and killing high level bosses in every game available, trying to make money to afford realisation of their plan.
      And today is the day. They have made enough money to afford the resources required by their huge 3D printer (which, naturally has been printed by serveral smaller 3D-printers) and are
      now in the process of creating their custom made Spaceship. And they have selected <strong>YOU</strong> to take the cockpit and find and destroy the evil alien menace threathening the
      sanity of earthly developers.
